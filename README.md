# Docusar Public

[Docusar](https://docusar.com) is developed in private repositories.

This public repo exists to track issues for the private repos.
Users can create issues, track progress and see the milestone planning.

This is needed as Github does not feature
[issues-only permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-an-issues-only-repository).
